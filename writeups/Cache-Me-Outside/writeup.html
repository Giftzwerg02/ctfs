<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>While being super relevant with my meme references, I wrote a program
to see how much you understand heap allocations.
<code>nc mercury.picoctf.net 17612</code></p>

Ghidra</h3>
<p>Since the compiled file is provided (<code>heapedit</code>), we can
decompile it and have a look at the code.</p>
<p>We see that the flag is loaded from a file on the server
(<code>flag.txt</code>) and then read into a variable
(<code>char flag [72]</code>)</p>

</figure>
<p>We can also see that the size of the flag string (char[]) is 72,
which is 9bytes, however, only 8 bytes (<code>0x40</code> = 64) are
being read from the file (<code>fgets(flag, 0x40, flagfile)</code>).
Maybe this is important, maybe not, who knows (I don’t).</p>
<p>Then a huge bunch of pointer-arithmetic-shit is being done in a
weird-ass loop, we won’t bother with this one for now.</p>
<p>We can then also see <code>strcat((char *)local_98,flag)</code></p>
<h4 id="man-strcat"><code>man strcat</code></h4>
<p><code>strcat(char *restrict dst, const char *restrict src)</code></p>
<p>appends the content of <code>src</code> to the content of
<code>dst</code>, basically in-place concatinating the dst-string with
the src-string.</p>
<p>Now, the thing is, this stuff happens every loop iteration, we can
see in the loop that this happens exactly 7 times. So the contents of
<code>local_98</code> now also contain our flag. Since
<code>local_98</code> gets assigned a new address space in the heap
(first line in the for-loop
<code>local_98 = (undefined8*) malloc(0x80)</code>) I am assuming that
we technically only care about the contents of <code>local_98</code> on
the very last iteration, since this is then kept after the loop. We can
also see a bunch of weird-ass addresses being written to this variable,
don’t know what to do with this info tho.</p>
<p>On line 48 we have a <code>free(local_98)</code>, which iirc only
marks this address-space as free, but the contents of it are still very
much there, since nothing else seems to be directly overriding it nor
did the contents of <code>local_98</code> get moved/copied to any other
variable I assume that we could still read the flag from that
address-space.</p>
<pre><code>free()
    The  free()  function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must have been returned by a
    previous call to malloc() or related functions.  Otherwise, or if ptr has already been freed,  un‐
    defined behavior occurs.  If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.</code></pre>

<p>Binary Exploitation is great and all but this is too much guesswork
